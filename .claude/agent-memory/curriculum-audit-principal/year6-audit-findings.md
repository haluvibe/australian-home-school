# Year 6 Maths Audit - Detailed Findings

## Data Errors (Must Fix)
1. Line 1557-1566: Fraction Bonds to 1 -- all bonds have null/null, renders blank
2. Line 2266: 0.01 m matched to "1 mm (approx)" -- should be "1 cm" (0.01 m = 10 mm = 1 cm)
3. Line 4225: Sequence [1000, 0, 100, 10, 1] answer [0] -- should be [100] for divide-by-10
4. Line 1378: Matching right array has duplicate "1/2" -- ambiguous for 1-to-1 matching
5. Line 364: Matching right array has duplicate "-2" -- ambiguous for 1-to-1 matching
6. Line 20: Sequence [0, -1, 0, 1, 2] -- two positions already show 0, confusing placeholder

## Content Beyond Year 6 Scope
- Absolute value (line 350-358): Formally Year 7+ concept
- Integer multiplication rules (line 604-613): Year 7 content
- Cube numbers (line 1138-1147): Year 7/8 content
- HCF and LCM (line 1023-1031): Year 7 content
- Index notation beyond squares (line 1107-1135): Year 7 content
- Twin primes, Goldbach's conjecture (line 1045-1064): Enrichment, beyond curriculum

## Overlapping Content
- Integers worksheet (WS1) covers Cartesian plane extensively
- Cartesian plane quadrants worksheet (WS17) also covers same content
- Both are linked to different curriculum objectives, but significant overlap exists
- Decimal-metric worksheet (WS5) and convert-length-mass-capacity (WS12) have overlapping conversions

## Strengths Observed
- Every worksheet has 25-50 activities (substantial depth)
- Easy/Medium/Hard progression within each worksheet
- Home activities in every worksheet
- Real-world Australian contexts (GST, bus/train timetables with Australian cities)
- Good use of open-response for reasoning/justification
