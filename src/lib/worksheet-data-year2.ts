    lesson: {
      title: "Numbers Past 100",
      objective: "Read, write and order three-digit numbers up to 1,000 by understanding hundreds, tens and ones.",
      materials: [
        "100 small objects (dried pasta, buttons, blocks)",
        "3 small containers or bowls",
        "Paper and pencil",
        "A number line drawn on a strip of paper (0 to 1000 in hundreds)",

        title: "The Big Count",
        script: "Look at all these — how many do you think there are? Take a guess! Now let me show you a faster way to think about big numbers. Watch — I am going to put them into groups of ten.",
        action: "Tip out the 100 objects. Let the child guess the total. Then together group them into 10s, then group the 10s into one big group of 100. Place it in a bowl labelled HUNDREDS.",
      },
      mainActivity: {
        title: "Build a Number",
        script: "I am going to call out a number — say, three hundred and forty-two — and you are going to show it to me using our bowls. Three hundreds, four tens, two ones. Then we write it: 342. The first digit tells us hundreds, the middle tells us tens, the last tells us ones.",
        action: "Call out 2-3 three-digit numbers. Child places objects in the three bowls (hundreds, tens, ones) and writes the number. Then draw a simple number line from 0 to 1000 and place numbers on it together.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Biggest and Smallest",
        script: "Can you tell me — which of these numbers is biggest? How do you know? What does the first digit tell us?",
        action: "Write three numbers on paper (e.g. 204, 420, 240). Child orders them from smallest to largest and explains reasoning.",
      },
      parentTip: "Don't worry if your child still needs to count individual objects to confirm a three-digit number — that's completely normal at this stage. The key milestone is recognising that the first digit tells us 'how many hundreds', and your physical grouping activity today builds exactly that understanding. If they get confused, just go back to the bowls.",
      extension: "Challenge your child to find the biggest number they can make using the digits 1 through 9 (using each digit only once in a three-digit number). Then find the smallest. Order three numbers written on cards from smallest to biggest and record them on a number line. This extends ordering and place-value reasoning.",

Resist the urge to explain it for them; instead, keep asking 'how many tens are hiding in that hundred bundle?' and let them puzzle it out.",
      extension: "Have your child build five different three-digit numbers using straws, then write each number in expanded form (e.g. 346 = 300 + 40 + 6) AND in as many renamed ways as they can (e.g. 34 tens and 6 ones). See who can find the most ways to rename 500.",

How many more do I need to get to 10? Two more! So I use 2 of the 6 to make 10, and I still have 4 left over. So 8 plus 6 is 14. Did you follow that?",
        action: "Demonstrate making ten using fingers slowly. Show child each step. Then repeat with 7 + 5 and have child try with their own fingers.",

      parentTip: "Speed is NOT the goal right now — strategy is. If your child counts on fingers for every fact, that's fine; gently introduce the 'make ten' strategy as an alternative rather than a replacement. Celebrate when they can explain their thinking: 'I know 8 + 6 because I made 10 first' shows far deeper understanding than just saying '14'.",
      extension: "Write subtraction fact family cards: choose a total (e.g. 15) and two parts (e.g. 7 and 8), then write all four related facts (7+8=15, 8+7=15, 15-7=8, 15-8=7). Make a set of 5 fact families and see if your child can spot the patterns between addition and subtraction.",

The skip-counting chant is powerful: repeat it in the car, at the table, anywhere you have 30 seconds.",

Your child writes 5 different patterns — mix of increasing and decreasing, with different step sizes (2, 3, 5, 10) — and you have to identify each rule. Then swap. As a challenge, make a two-rule pattern: e.g. +3, +5, +3, +5, ... and see if they can spot the alternating structure.",

A common error is finding the rule between two visible numbers but not noticing the gap spans two steps.",

Then try patterns that decrease and have a gap near the start. Finally, make a 'mystery pattern' table: input numbers 1-5 in one column, output (e.g. input x 3) in the second, and have your child find the rule.",

      extension: "Create a 'measurement journal' for the day. Your child measures 10 objects around the house using their chosen informal unit (paperclips, pencils, dried pasta pieces) and records each in a table.

        title: "Two Hands, Two Jobs",
        script: "Look at this clock. It has two hands — a short one and a long one. They each have a different job. The short hand is the HOUR hand. It moves slowly and points to the hour. The long hand is the MINUTE hand. When the minute hand points straight up — to 12 — it means exactly on the hour.",
        action: "Point to each hand on a real clock. Move the minute hand on a model clock to show 12, 6, 3 and 9 while explaining what each position means. Let the child point to and move the hands.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Show Me the Time",
        script: "I am going to say a time and you set our model clock to show it. Three o clock. Great — the short hand points to 3, the long hand points to 12. Now half past five. The minute hand goes to 6, the short hand goes BETWEEN 5 and 6. Half past means the minute hand has gone halfway around.",
        action: "Call out times: o clock, half past, quarter past and quarter to. Child sets the model clock. Do 6-8 examples. Then swap: child sets the time and you read it aloud.",

        script: "Look at our real clock. What time does it say right now? Is the minute hand pointing to 12, 6, 3 or 9? What does that mean? Tell me the time in words.",

      },
      parentTip: "Analog clocks are genuinely confusing — two hands that count different things, moving at different speeds, on a circular number line that repeats. If your child gets muddled, focus first on just the hour hand (cover the minute hand with your finger). Once they're confident with o'clock and half past, quarter-to is the trickiest because it uses the language of what's still to come rather than what's already passed.",
      extension: "Make a 'daily timetable' using analog clock drawings. Your child draws the clock face for breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime and one other event — then writes the time in words and in digital format (e.g. 7:30). Stick it on the fridge and use it to practise reading the real clock during the day.",

Also watch for the common mix-up of 'sides' and 'corners' — point to each distinctly.",

It can feel slow and messy, but that's exactly what real mathematical investigation looks like. Resist the urge to tidy up their graph for them; a child-made, slightly crooked bar graph is worth far more than a parent-corrected perfect one.",
      extension: "Extend the investigation over a week. On Monday your child decides the question. Tuesday-Thursday they collect data (at least 15 responses). Friday they organise, display, and present their findings. You be the 'audience' and ask three questions about the graph. Then they write a two-sentence conclusion: what they found, and what they would investigate next.",
