        title: "What Is a Surd?",
        script: "You already know that the square root of 9 is 3 — a nice whole number. But what about the square root of 5? When you press it on a calculator you get 2.2360679... and those digits never stop and never repeat. That is a surd — a square root that gives an irrational number. A rational number is any number you can write as a fraction. An irrational number cannot be written as any fraction, ever. Surds are one family of irrational numbers; pi is another. Today we are going to get comfortable working with surds: simplifying them, estimating them, and using them to solve problems.",
        action: "Write on paper: Rational: 1/2, 0.75, -3, sqrt(9)=3. Irrational: sqrt(2), sqrt(5), pi, sqrt(7). Ask your child to use a calculator to evaluate sqrt(4), sqrt(9), sqrt(16), sqrt(25) — these are perfect squares, so they give whole numbers and are rational. Then sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(5) — these do not terminate or repeat, so they are irrational.",

        title: "Simplifying Surds and Estimating",
        script: "To simplify a surd, look for the largest perfect-square factor inside. For sqrt of 18: 18 equals 9 times 2. So sqrt of 18 equals sqrt of 9 times sqrt of 2 equals 3 times sqrt of 2. We write that as 3 root 2. To estimate a surd without a calculator, think about which two perfect squares it sits between. For sqrt of 20: 16 is 4 squared and 25 is 5 squared. So sqrt of 20 is between 4 and 5. Since 20 is closer to 25, it is closer to 5 — roughly 4.5. Now you simplify: sqrt of 50. And estimate: sqrt of 30.",
        action: "Work through: sqrt(18) = 3 sqrt(2) as above. Then child works sqrt(50): 50 = 25 x 2, so sqrt(50) = 5 sqrt(2). For estimation: sqrt(30) is between sqrt(25)=5 and sqrt(36)=6. Closer to 5.5. Check with calculator. Practise two more: simplify sqrt(72) and estimate sqrt(90).",

      },
      parentTip: "At Year 9, students are expected to simplify surds — a step up from Year 8 classification tasks. If your teenager can classify numbers confidently but struggles to simplify, check whether they know their perfect square times tables up to at least 144. That knowledge is the prerequisite. Encourage independent work on estimation tasks especially; estimation builds mathematical intuition that calculators cannot replace.",
      extension: "Investigate the convergents of the continued fraction for sqrt(2): the sequence 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70... Each fraction is closer to sqrt(2) than the last. Calculate the first six convergents and verify by squaring each one. Find the rule for generating the next term from the previous two. This connects to AC9M9N01 and introduces the idea of rational approximation to irrational numbers.",

        script: "The distance from Earth to the nearest star other than the Sun is 40,208,000,000,000 kilometres. Writing that out every time is impractical, and it is easy to miscount the zeros. Scientists invented a shorthand: instead of writing all those zeros, they write 4.0208 times 10 to the power of 13. This tells you: take 4.0208 and move the decimal point 13 places to the right. The same trick works for tiny numbers like the diameter of a hydrogen atom: 0.000000000106 metres is written as 1.06 times 10 to the power of negative 11. Today we learn to convert numbers into this scientific notation and back.",
        action: "Write 4,500 on paper. Ask: how many times do we multiply by 10 to get from 4.5 to 4500? (Three times, so 4.5 x 10^3.) Then write 0.0045 and ask: how many times do we divide by 10? (Three times, so 4.5 x 10^-3.) The key rule: the number in front must be at least 1 and less than 10.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Converting Both Ways",
        script: "To convert to scientific notation: move the decimal point until you have a number between 1 and 10. Count how many places you moved. If you moved left (for a big number), the exponent is positive. If you moved right (for a small number), the exponent is negative. Example: 300,000,000 metres per second. Move the decimal 8 places left to get 3.0. So it is 3.0 times 10 to the 8. To convert back: 6.022 times 10 to the 23 — move the decimal 23 places right. For calculating: multiply the front numbers, then add the exponents. So 3 times 10 to the 4, times 2 times 10 to the 3, equals 6 times 10 to the 7. Now you convert: 0.00007 metres.",
        action: "Child works: 0.00007 = 7 x 10^-5. Then try the reverse: write 9.46 x 10^15 as a standard number (move decimal 15 places right). For calculations, try: (4 x 10^3) x (2 x 10^4) = 8 x 10^7. Check with calculator. Also show a division: (8 x 10^6) / (4 x 10^2) = 2 x 10^4.",

        action: "Child calculates: time = distance / speed = (1.5 x 10^11) / (3 x 10^8) = 0.5 x 10^3 = 5 x 10^2 = 500 seconds. If they struggle with the division, show them: 1.5 / 3 = 0.5, then 10^11 / 10^8 = 10^3, then rewrite 0.5 x 10^3 as 5 x 10^2. This confirms they are ready for the worksheet.",
      },
      parentTip: "Scientific notation is conceptually straightforward but students often make sign errors with the exponent, confusing very large and very small numbers. A useful check: if the original number is greater than 1, the exponent is positive; if it is between 0 and 1, the exponent is negative. Have your teenager state this rule aloud before every conversion until it becomes automatic. Real-world contexts like the size of a virus or the distance to a star make the notation feel purposeful.",

Think about what happens as we count down the powers: 2 to the 3 is 8, 2 to the 2 is 4, 2 to the 1 is 2, 2 to the 0 is 1 (because dividing by 2 each time). One more step: 2 to the negative 1 is one half. 2 to the negative 2 is one quarter. So a negative exponent means take the reciprocal. 2 to the negative 3 equals 1 over 2 cubed, which is 1 over 8. And anything to the power zero equals 1 — because you have divided by that base as many times as you multiplied.",

This reconstruction habit is more durable than re-memorising the rule.",

Think of factor pairs of 12: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4. Which pair adds to 7? Three and four! So x squared plus 7x plus 12 equals (x plus 3) times (x plus 4).",

Fireworks, satellite dishes, and suspension bridges all use parabolic shapes. The equation looks like y equals ax squared plus bx plus c, and the graph is always a U-shape or an upside-down U-shape depending on whether a is positive or negative. Today we are going to learn to identify the key features of a parabola and sketch one without needing to plot lots of points.",

Now for a harder one: y equals x squared minus 6x plus 8. First factorise: (x minus 2)(x minus 4). X-intercepts at x equals 2 and x equals 4. Axis of symmetry is halfway: x equals 3. Vertex y-value: substitute x equals 3: y equals 9 minus 18 plus 8 equals negative 1. Vertex is at (3, -1). Y-intercept: substitute x equals 0: y equals 8.
