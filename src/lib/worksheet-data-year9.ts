        title: "What Is a Surd?",
        script: "You already know that the square root of 9 is 3 — a nice whole number. But what about the square root of 5? When you press it on a calculator you get 2.2360679... and those digits never stop and never repeat. That is a surd — a square root that gives an irrational number. A rational number is any number you can write as a fraction. An irrational number cannot be written as any fraction, ever. Surds are one family of irrational numbers; pi is another. Today we are going to get comfortable working with surds: simplifying them, estimating them, and using them to solve problems.",
        action: "Write on paper: Rational: 1/2, 0.75, -3, sqrt(9)=3. Irrational: sqrt(2), sqrt(5), pi, sqrt(7). Ask your child to use a calculator to evaluate sqrt(4), sqrt(9), sqrt(16), sqrt(25) — these are perfect squares, so they give whole numbers and are rational. Then sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(5) — these do not terminate or repeat, so they are irrational.",

        title: "Simplifying Surds and Estimating",
        script: "To simplify a surd, look for the largest perfect-square factor inside. For sqrt of 18: 18 equals 9 times 2. So sqrt of 18 equals sqrt of 9 times sqrt of 2 equals 3 times sqrt of 2. We write that as 3 root 2. To estimate a surd without a calculator, think about which two perfect squares it sits between. For sqrt of 20: 16 is 4 squared and 25 is 5 squared. So sqrt of 20 is between 4 and 5. Since 20 is closer to 25, it is closer to 5 — roughly 4.5. Now you simplify: sqrt of 50. And estimate: sqrt of 30.",
        action: "Work through: sqrt(18) = 3 sqrt(2) as above. Then child works sqrt(50): 50 = 25 x 2, so sqrt(50) = 5 sqrt(2). For estimation: sqrt(30) is between sqrt(25)=5 and sqrt(36)=6. Closer to 5.5. Check with calculator. Practise two more: simplify sqrt(72) and estimate sqrt(90).",

      },
      parentTip: "At Year 9, students are expected to simplify surds — a step up from Year 8 classification tasks. If your teenager can classify numbers confidently but struggles to simplify, check whether they know their perfect square times tables up to at least 144. That knowledge is the prerequisite. Encourage independent work on estimation tasks especially; estimation builds mathematical intuition that calculators cannot replace.",
      extension: "Investigate the convergents of the continued fraction for sqrt(2): the sequence 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70... Each fraction is closer to sqrt(2) than the last. Calculate the first six convergents and verify by squaring each one. Find the rule for generating the next term from the previous two. This connects to AC9M9N01 and introduces the idea of rational approximation to irrational numbers.",

        script: "The distance from Earth to the nearest star other than the Sun is 40,208,000,000,000 kilometres. Writing that out every time is impractical, and it is easy to miscount the zeros. Scientists invented a shorthand: instead of writing all those zeros, they write 4.0208 times 10 to the power of 13. This tells you: take 4.0208 and move the decimal point 13 places to the right. The same trick works for tiny numbers like the diameter of a hydrogen atom: 0.000000000106 metres is written as 1.06 times 10 to the power of negative 11. Today we learn to convert numbers into this scientific notation and back.",
        action: "Write 4,500 on paper. Ask: how many times do we multiply by 10 to get from 4.5 to 4500? (Three times, so 4.5 x 10^3.) Then write 0.0045 and ask: how many times do we divide by 10? (Three times, so 4.5 x 10^-3.) The key rule: the number in front must be at least 1 and less than 10.",

        title: "Converting Both Ways",
        script: "To convert to scientific notation: move the decimal point until you have a number between 1 and 10. Count how many places you moved. If you moved left (for a big number), the exponent is positive. If you moved right (for a small number), the exponent is negative. Example: 300,000,000 metres per second. Move the decimal 8 places left to get 3.0. So it is 3.0 times 10 to the 8. To convert back: 6.022 times 10 to the 23 — move the decimal 23 places right. For calculating: multiply the front numbers, then add the exponents. So 3 times 10 to the 4, times 2 times 10 to the 3, equals 6 times 10 to the 7. Now you convert: 0.00007 metres.",
        action: "Child works: 0.00007 = 7 x 10^-5. Then try the reverse: write 9.46 x 10^15 as a standard number (move decimal 15 places right). For calculations, try: (4 x 10^3) x (2 x 10^4) = 8 x 10^7. Check with calculator. Also show a division: (8 x 10^6) / (4 x 10^2) = 2 x 10^4.",

        action: "Child calculates: time = distance / speed = (1.5 x 10^11) / (3 x 10^8) = 0.5 x 10^3 = 5 x 10^2 = 500 seconds. If they struggle with the division, show them: 1.5 / 3 = 0.5, then 10^11 / 10^8 = 10^3, then rewrite 0.5 x 10^3 as 5 x 10^2. This confirms they are ready for the worksheet.",
      },
      parentTip: "Scientific notation is conceptually straightforward but students often make sign errors with the exponent, confusing very large and very small numbers. A useful check: if the original number is greater than 1, the exponent is positive; if it is between 0 and 1, the exponent is negative. Have your teenager state this rule aloud before every conversion until it becomes automatic. Real-world contexts like the size of a virus or the distance to a star make the notation feel purposeful.",

Think about what happens as we count down the powers: 2 to the 3 is 8, 2 to the 2 is 4, 2 to the 1 is 2, 2 to the 0 is 1 (because dividing by 2 each time). One more step: 2 to the negative 1 is one half. 2 to the negative 2 is one quarter. So a negative exponent means take the reciprocal. 2 to the negative 3 equals 1 over 2 cubed, which is 1 over 8. And anything to the power zero equals 1 — because you have divided by that base as many times as you multiplied.",

Today we do that in reverse — we start with x squared plus 7x plus 12 and try to find the two brackets. This is called factorising. It is like working out what two numbers were multiplied together to make something. The trick: we need two numbers that multiply to give 12 (the last number) AND add to give 7 (the middle number). Think of factor pairs of 12: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4. Which pair adds to 7? Three and four! So x squared plus 7x plus 12 equals (x plus 3) times (x plus 4).",

For x squared plus 3x minus 10: multiply to negative 10, add to positive 3. One positive, one negative: try (5, -2) — multiply to -10, add to 3. Yes! So (x plus 5) times (x minus 2).

Here is why: if x squared equals 9, then x could be 3 (because 3 times 3 is 9) OR x could be negative 3 (because negative 3 times negative 3 is also 9). That gives two answers! The key method for solving quadratics is: factorise the left side, set each factor equal to zero, and solve each mini-equation. This works because if two things multiply to make zero, at least one of them MUST be zero.",

Check: put x equals 2 into the original — 4 minus 10 plus 6 equals 0. Correct. Sometimes the equation is not in the right form. For x squared equals 7x minus 10, rearrange first: x squared minus 7x plus 10 equals 0. Then factorise: (x minus 2) times (x minus 5) equals 0. Solutions: x equals 2 or x equals 5.

Fireworks, satellite dishes, and suspension bridges all use parabolic shapes. The equation looks like y equals ax squared plus bx plus c, and the graph is always a U-shape or an upside-down U-shape depending on whether a is positive or negative. Today we are going to learn to identify the key features of a parabola and sketch one without needing to plot lots of points.",

Now for a harder one: y equals x squared minus 6x plus 8. First factorise: (x minus 2)(x minus 4). X-intercepts at x equals 2 and x equals 4. Axis of symmetry is halfway: x equals 3. Vertex y-value: substitute x equals 3: y equals 9 minus 18 plus 8 equals negative 1. Vertex is at (3, -1). Y-intercept: substitute x equals 0: y equals 8. Now you identify the features of y equals x squared plus 2x minus 3.",

        script: "A wheelchair ramp rises 1 metre over a horizontal run of 6 metres. What angle does it make with the ground? Pythagoras can find a missing side but it cannot find an angle. For that we need trigonometry — the study of ratios in right-angled triangles. There are three ratios, and we remember them using the word SOH CAH TOA. Sin of an angle equals Opposite over Hypotenuse. Cos equals Adjacent over Hypotenuse. Tan equals Opposite over Adjacent. The adjacent side is next to the angle; the opposite side is across from it; the hypotenuse is always the longest side, across from the right angle.",
        action: "Draw a right-angled triangle on paper. Label the right angle, and choose one other angle to call theta. Label the three sides: hypotenuse (always opposite the right angle), opposite (across from theta), and adjacent (next to theta, not the hypotenuse). Write SOH CAH TOA in large letters. Practice labelling by drawing two or three more triangles with the angle in different positions.",

        title: "Finding Sides and Angles",
        script: "To find a missing side: write the ratio that involves your known angle, your known side, and your unknown side. For example: angle 30 degrees, hypotenuse 10 cm, find the opposite side. Use SOH: sin 30 = opposite over 10. Opposite = 10 times sin 30 = 10 times 0.5 = 5 cm. To find a missing angle: take the ratio of two known sides, then use the inverse function. Opposite is 6, hypotenuse is 12: sin theta = 6/12 = 0.5, so theta = sin inverse of 0.5 = 30 degrees. I will do one of each and then you do one of each. Your turn: find the opposite side when the angle is 45 degrees and the adjacent is 8 cm.",
        action: "For finding a side: child uses tan 45 = opposite/8, so opposite = 8 x tan 45 = 8 x 1 = 8 cm.

Labelling all three sides before applying any formula prevents the most common errors, so insist on this step every time.",

Go outside and measure the angle of elevation to a tree or building, then measure the horizontal distance to its base. Use trigonometry to calculate the height.

It has three surfaces: the circular top, the circular bottom, and the curved label that wraps around the side. If you unrolled the label, it would be a rectangle. Its width is the circumference of the circle, its height is the height of the can. So total surface area equals 2 times pi r squared (the two circles) plus 2 pi r h (the curved label). Volume is different — it is the space inside, and for cylinders it is pi r squared times h.",

Let me find the volume and surface area of a rectangular box that is 6 cm by 4 cm by 3 cm. Volume: 6 times 4 times 3 equals 72 cubic centimetres.

      parentTip: "Year 9 similarity builds on Year 8 congruence and requires students to work confidently with scale factors. A common error is applying the linear scale factor to area — remind your child that if the linear scale factor is k, areas scale by k squared. If scale problems feel dry, give them a real map of Australia and ask them to calculate actual distances between cities using the printed map scale; suddenly the concept has genuine purpose.",
      extension: "Find a photograph of a tall structure such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Melbourne Arts Centre spire. Print it and measure the height of a person standing near the structure and the height of the structure in the photo. Use the scale factor (real person height divided by photo person height) to estimate the real height of the structure. Research the actual height and calculate your percentage error. This connects to AC9M9SP02 and proportional reasoning.",

First draw: Red or Blue, each probability one half. If Red was drawn first, the second draw is Blue with probability 1 (only one marble left). If Blue was drawn first, the second draw is Red with probability 1. So the outcomes are (R, B) and (B, R) — no same-colour outcome is possible.

Both classes have the same mean of 68.5. But do they perform the same? No! Class B is much more spread out. This is why we need more than just the mean to compare data. The range tells us total spread, the interquartile range (IQR) tells us where the middle 50% of data sits, and the shape of the distribution tells us if most scores are high, low, or in the middle.",

Mean: add all values and divide by 10. Median: average the 5th and 6th values. Mode: the most common value. Range: maximum minus minimum. For IQR: find Q1 (median of lower half) and Q3 (median of upper half), then IQR equals Q3 minus Q1. Distribution shape: if mean is greater than median, the data is positively skewed (long tail to the right); if mean is less than median, negatively skewed; if equal, roughly symmetric.",

Encourage your teenager to always write a comparison sentence that names both data sets (for example: Group A had a higher median than Group B, suggesting...). If they struggle with box plots, have them construct one by hand from a small data set first; building a display develops interpretation skills much faster than just reading one.",
