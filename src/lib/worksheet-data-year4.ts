    lesson: {
      title: "Cutting Things into Tenths and Hundredths",
      objective: "Represent tenths and hundredths as decimals and connect fraction notation to decimal notation on a place value chart.",
      materials: [
        "A sheet of paper and scissors",
        "A pencil and ruler",
        "10 small coins or counters",
      ],
      intro: {
        title: "Slicing the Strip",
        script: "I am going to fold this piece of paper into 10 equal parts. Watch. Each part is one tenth — we write that as the fraction 1 over 10, or as the decimal 0.1. Now look — if I fold one of those ten strips into 10 smaller parts, I get hundredths. One hundredth is written 0.01. Let me show you how tiny that is compared to a whole.",
        action: "Fold a strip of paper in half three times to get 8 sections, then fold once more to get 10 rough sections. Tear one section off and hold it up. Then fold that section into 10 tiny pieces to show a hundredth. Keep both visible throughout the intro.",
      },
      mainActivity: {
        title: "Place the Decimal",
        script: "Let us use a place value chart together. Ones go here, tenths go here — after the dot — and hundredths go even further right. I will show you a few fractions and you tell me what decimal they make. 3 tenths — where does the 3 go? After the point: 0.3. Good. Now 7 hundredths — that is 0.07. See how there is a zero in the tenths column? Now you try some.",
        action: "Draw a simple place value chart on paper with columns: Ones | . | Tenths | Hundredths. Write fractions and ask the child to place digits. Do at least 6 examples together before the child works alone. Watch for confusion between 0.7 and 0.07.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Explain It Back",
        script: "Tell me: what is the difference between 0.3 and 0.03? Use the chart to help you explain. And if I write 0.57, what does the 5 mean? What does the 7 mean?",
        action: "Listen for the child to say tenths and hundredths with correct column positions. If they struggle, point to the chart and ask which column each digit is sitting in.",
      },
      parentTip: "Confusion between 0.3 and 0.03 is extremely common at this stage — children often read 0.3 as 'zero point three' without connecting it to three tenths. A physical place value chart on the table during the lesson makes a huge difference; let your child point to the column as they say the name.",
      extension: "Ask your child to find three prices in a supermarket catalogue and write each as a fraction. For example, $2.75 = 2 and 75 hundredths. Then challenge them to order five prices from cheapest to most expensive, justifying each step using place value language.",

Make it meaningful by using estimation as a real checking tool — before they grab a calculator or count carefully, ask 'what do you expect the answer to be roughly?' Developing this habit is more valuable than getting the rounded number exactly right.",

There is one left over with no partner — that means 7 is odd. Even numbers always pair up perfectly. Odd numbers always leave one behind.",
        action: "Give the child handfuls of coins to test. Start with 8, then 7, then 12, then 15. Each time ask: is it odd or even? How do you know? Make sure they use pairing to confirm, not just memory.",

Frame the unknown as a mystery or puzzle: 'there IS an answer, we just haven't found it yet.' The checking step (substituting back) is powerful — once your child sees it work, their confidence jumps noticeably.",
      extension: "Create 'Equation Riddle Cards': write 5 real-world riddles where the unknown is hidden (e.g. 'I had some money, spent $17, and have $28 left — how much did I start with?'). Your child writes the equation, solves it, and checks it. Then they write their own riddle for you to solve. This aligns to AC V9 Year 4 Algebra strand.",

When an arrow or pointer falls between two labelled marks, I need to read how far between. Let me show you with this pencil.",
        action: "Lay a pencil on the ruler so it ends between 14 and 15 cm. Point to the small divisions. Count them together: the pencil is at 14.7 cm. Then show water in the measuring jug between two 100 mL marks so the child practises reading between marked values.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Measure and Record",
        script: "We are going to measure 4 things and record each reading. First, measure the length of this book. Then pour some water and read the jug. Then I want you to read the kitchen scale with this object on it. For each one, tell me the number and the unit — cm, mL, g or degrees.",
        action: "Set up each measurement station. For each, ask the child to identify: what is the scale measuring, what are the labelled marks, how many divisions are between marks, and what is each division worth. Record readings on paper.",

        title: "The Halfway Problem",
        script: "If a scale goes from 200 g to 300 g and the pointer is exactly halfway between, what does it read? And if it is one quarter of the way from 300 to 400, what does it read?",
        action: "Ask the child to explain their reasoning. The key idea is that they need to find the value of one division and then count up from the lower mark. Use the real scale to confirm if possible.",
      },
      parentTip: "Reading the exact value on a scale is surprisingly tricky — children often read the nearest labelled mark without counting divisions. Slow down and count the divisions aloud together: 'This mark says 200, the next says 250, so there are 5 divisions between them — each one is 10.' This metacognitive step is worth repeating on every new instrument.",
      extension: "Set up a 'measurement station challenge': choose four household objects and four instruments (ruler, kitchen scales, measuring jug, thermometer). Your child measures each object, records the reading including the unit, and then converts between related units where possible (e.g. 1.2 kg = 1200 g). This extends AC V9 Year 4 Measurement — scaled instruments and unit conversion.",

These are two completely different measurements. One measures a distance, the other measures a region. Let me use this string to show you.",

      extension: "Challenge your child to find the optimal rectangle: using exactly 24 square centimetres of grid paper, how many different rectangles can they make? List all of them, calculate each perimeter, and find which has the smallest and which has the largest perimeter. Discuss: why does a square give the smallest perimeter for a fixed area?

Now I am going to hold up this book at different angles and you tell me: is the angle of the opening bigger or smaller than our paper corner? If it is smaller, it is acute. If it is bigger but less than a straight line, it is obtuse.",

      parentTip: "Children sometimes call every corner a right angle regardless of its size. Using a physical tester — the corner of a piece of paper — every single time (even when the answer is obvious) builds the habit of referencing the standard before judging. This is more important than getting the name right; it teaches what the reference point is.",
      extension: "Go on an 'angle safari' in your home or garden. Your child photographs or sketches 10 different angles they can find: in furniture, architecture, plants or tools. Back at the table, they classify each as acute, right, obtuse or straight, and explain their reasoning. They can draw a simple acute-to-straight scale to show where each angle sits, aligned to AC V9 Year 4 Space.",

You always say the letter first, then the number — like reading a sentence, across then up. So B3 means: go across to column B, then go up 3 rows. Let me show you.",
        action: "Draw a 5 by 5 grid on paper with letters A to E along the bottom and numbers 1 to 5 up the side. Place a small sticker in one cell and ask the child to give the reference. Then you say a reference and they point to the cell. Do 5 rounds.",

        title: "Place and Find",
        script: "Now you are the map maker. Place these objects at these grid references: pencil at C4, rubber at A2, book at E3. I will look away and then use your grid to find each one. Then you use my grid to find my hidden objects.",

A helpful anchor phrase is 'along the corridor, then up the stairs'. Reinforce it every single time in the early lessons — the habit needs many repetitions before it becomes automatic.",

        script: "If I fold this piece of paper in half and both halves match perfectly, the fold line is a line of symmetry. Watch — I fold this heart shape and the two sides line up exactly. Now look at this letter B. Can I fold it so both halves match? What about the letter A? Some shapes have one line of symmetry, some have many, some have none.",
        action: "Cut out simple shapes: a circle, a square, a rectangle, a triangle, and an irregular blob. For each, child predicts how many lines of symmetry then folds to check. Use the mirror to test as well by placing it on the shape.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Create and Count",
        script: "Draw a large square on your paper. I want you to find all the lines of symmetry — draw them on the shape. A square has 4 lines: two through the midpoints of opposite sides, and two through opposite corners. Now draw a regular triangle and find its lines. Then I will show you rotational symmetry — a shape that looks the same when you spin it.",
        action: "Draw shapes and ask the child to draw all lines of symmetry. For rotational symmetry, cut out a square and put a pencil through the centre, then spin it — mark how many times it looks the same in one full turn. A square has rotational symmetry of order 4.",

        script: "Fold a piece of paper in half. Draw half a butterfly wing on the fold line. Cut it out and unfold it. What do you notice? The wings are identical — that is line symmetry. Can you design another symmetrical shape using this fold-and-cut method?",

      parentTip: "Rotational symmetry is the trickier of the two concepts here — children often confuse 'it looks the same' with 'it is the same shape'. When testing rotational symmetry, physically cut out the shape and rotate it over its own outline so your child can feel the match, not just imagine it. The fold-and-cut activity in the wrap-up is especially powerful for this age.",
      extension: "Investigate the symmetry of capital letters. Write all 26 capital letters and sort them: no symmetry, line symmetry only, rotational symmetry only, or both. For example, H has both. Record findings in a table. Then design a personal logo using at least one line of symmetry. This visual art integration aligns to AC V9 Year 4 Space.",

      extension: "Collect data for a week: each day, record how many minutes of reading, outdoor play and screen time you each had. At the end of the week, create a grouped column graph using a many-to-one scale (each unit = 10 minutes). Compare categories and write 3 statements about what the data shows. This is a full AC V9 Year 4 Statistics investigation.",

This builds a healthy relationship with uncertainty.",

      objective: "Plan and conduct a simple survey by choosing a clear question, collecting data using a tally chart, and representing results in a graph.",

        "Paper and pencil",
        "A tally chart template drawn on paper",

        title: "What Makes a Good Survey Question?",
        script: "I want to find out what people like to eat for breakfast. Here are two questions I could ask. Question one: Do you eat breakfast? Question two: What do you usually eat for breakfast? Which question gives me better data? The second one — it gives me specific, useful answers. A good survey question is clear, neutral and gives you information you can actually count and display.",
        action: "Write both questions on paper. Discuss: question one only gives yes or no — not very informative. Ask the child to suggest two more topics they would like to survey and help them craft a clear, specific question for each.",
      },
      mainActivity: {
        title: "Design and Collect",
        script: "We are going to design a mini survey together. Pick a question — something you are genuinely curious about. Plan the possible answers in a tally chart. Then ask at least 3 people in the house your question and record the results. If you cannot ask 3 people, we can make up some sensible responses together.",
        action: "Help the child set up a tally chart with the question at the top and answer options listed. If the household is small, you can both respond and add a couple of imagined responses to get a useful data set. Record tallies together.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Display and Conclude",
        script: "Now turn your tally chart into a column graph. When you are done, tell me one thing the data shows and one question it makes you want to ask next.",
        action: "Check the graph for correct labelling and appropriate scale. The follow-up question is important — it models the idea that data often raises new questions. Praise curiosity as much as accuracy.",
      },
      parentTip: "Survey design is a skill, not just data collection. If your child's question is too vague (e.g. 'Do you like sport?'), help them sharpen it by asking 'What exactly do you want to find out?' and 'What answers would you expect?' Practising this before collecting data saves having to redo the survey, which is a great real-life lesson about planning.",
      extension: "Design a digital survey using Google Forms (free) with at least 3 questions, each offering 4 answer options. Share it with family or friends to collect at least 5 responses. Then create graphs from the results and write a short paragraph summarising the findings. This authentic AC V9 Year 4 Statistics task mirrors real data science workflows.",

These are independent events — one does not affect the other. But now watch this: I put 3 red blocks and 2 blue blocks in the bag and pull one out without putting it back. Now does the chance of the next draw change? Yes — there are fewer blocks left. These are dependent events.",

Fourth — picking a name from a hat and not putting it back, then picking again.",
        action: "Write the 6 pairs on paper, one at a time. Child classifies each with a reason. Listen for the key reasoning: if the first event changes what is available or possible for the second, they are dependent. If nothing changes, they are independent.",

Without looking, draw one marble and record it — then try both ways: put it back (independent) and don't put it back (dependent). After 20 draws each way, compare results. Does the 'without replacement' set show more of one colour over time? Discuss why. This is an AC V9 Year 4 Probability experiment.",

Did we get exactly 5 heads? Probably not — and that is completely normal. The theoretical chance is half, but actual results vary. That is variation, and it is real and interesting.",
        action: "Flip a coin 10 times together and record using tally marks. Compare to the prediction of 5. Discuss: is 4 heads a mistake? What about 7 heads? Both are possible just by chance.",
      },
      mainActivity: {
        title: "Repeat and Compare",
        script: "We are going to flip the coin 20 times and record results. Then we will do it again a second time and see if we get the same result. If we do, that would be surprising. Variation means results change, but over time, the pattern should move closer to what we expect: about half heads.",
        action: "Do two separate sets of 20 flips, recording each in its own tally chart. Compare totals. Discuss: which set was closer to 10 heads? If time allows, combine both sets and see if 40 flips is closer to 20 heads. This introduces the idea that more trials = more reliable results.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Why Does It Vary?",
        script: "If I flip a coin 100 times, would I get exactly 50 heads? Probably not. But would I be closer to 50 than if I only flipped it 10 times? Tell me why you think more flips gives a more reliable result.",
        action: "Listen for the idea that each flip is random but over many flips, the results balance out more. This is a core statistical concept — do not worry if the child cannot fully articulate it. Affirm partial understanding and reinforce with the data from the activity.",
      },
      parentTip: "When experimental results don't match expected probability, children can feel they did it 'wrong'. Explain that with a small number of trials, almost any result is possible — 8 heads from 10 flips is not wrong, it is just the natural variation of chance. The key message is: the more trials we do, the closer we get to what we expect. This is a profound idea worth dwelling on.",
      extension: "Run the 'Law of Large Numbers' investigation: flip a coin in sets of 10 flips, recording results after 10, 20, 50 and 100 total flips. After each set, calculate the percentage of heads. Create a line graph showing how the percentage changes as the number of trials increases. Does it get closer to 50%? Discuss why. This beautifully illustrates AC V9 Year 4 Probability and variation.",
