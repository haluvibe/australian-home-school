        title: "What Are Prime Numbers?",
        script: "Let us start with a question: can you make a rectangle using exactly 7 tiles? Try it. What about 12 tiles? With 12 you can make several different rectangles. Numbers like 12 that can be arranged into multiple rectangles are called composite. Numbers like 7 that only make one skinny rectangle are called prime. Today we are going to pull composite numbers apart until every piece is prime.",
        action: "If you have coins or small blocks, have your child try to arrange 7 objects into rectangles, then 12 objects. Discuss why 7 only works as 1 x 7. List a few primes together on paper: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Factor Trees and Exponents",
        script: "Let us break down 24 together. I will draw a factor tree. 24 splits into 4 and 6. Then 4 splits into 2 and 2, and 6 splits into 2 and 3. Our prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 3. Because we have three 2s, we write that as 2 to the power of 3, then multiply by 3. So 24 equals 2 cubed times 3. Now you try 36 on your own and I will check your tree.",
        action: "Draw the factor tree for 24 on paper, talking through each branch. Show how repeated primes collapse into exponent notation. Have your child draw their own tree for 36 and check it gives 2 squared times 3 squared. Then try 48 together.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Why Does This Matter?",
        script: "Can you think of why we might need to break numbers into prime factors? It turns out it helps us find the highest common factor of two numbers — really useful when simplifying fractions. Tell me in your own words: what is a prime number, and what does an exponent tell us?",
        action: "Have your child explain both concepts aloud. Ask them to quickly write the prime factorisation of 30 without a tree. Check the answer is 2 times 3 times 5.",
      },
      parentTip: "Factor trees are often a lightbulb moment, so if your child finds them satisfying let them run with larger numbers like 360 or 1024. If they are struggling to remember which numbers are prime, keep a short list visible on the desk — checking against a list is a legitimate strategy, not cheating. Year 7 students often confuse 1 as prime; gently remind them that 1 is neither prime nor composite.",
      extension: "Challenge your student to use prime factorisation to find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of three numbers at once — try 12, 18 and 30. They should list the prime factorisation of each, then identify shared and combined primes. As an extension to the extension, look up RSA encryption online: it uses the difficulty of factorising very large numbers to keep internet data safe.",

That is why we call 25 a perfect square — it can form a perfect square shape. The square root of 25 is 5 because 5 is the side length. Let us draw some squares and see the pattern.",

        title: "Squaring and Rooting",
        script: "Squaring means multiplying a number by itself. So 7 squared is 7 times 7 equals 49. The square root goes the other way: if I tell you the area of a square is 49, you need to find the side length. What number times itself gives 49? That is 7. We write that as the square root of 49 equals 7. Now let us estimate: is the square root of 50 closer to 7 or 8?",
        action: "Work through squaring the numbers 1 to 12, having your child call them out from memory or compute them.

Letting them self-check with area diagrams builds lasting understanding.",

Negative numbers live to the left of zero on the number line. A bank balance of minus 10 dollars means you owe money. Let us draw a number line from negative 10 to positive 10 and place some real-world examples on it.",

You move 9 steps left. Where do you land? Here is the tricky bit: subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. So 6 minus negative 2 is the same as 6 plus 2, which is 8.",
        action: "Work through at least 6 examples together on the number line, using a pencil to physically trace the movement.

If 5 minus negative 3 equals 8 causes confusion, the number line is your best friend: start at 5 and removing a negative means moving right. Keep a thermometer or a drawn number line nearby throughout this lesson. Be patient if your child needs several concrete examples before moving to abstract working; this concept is foundational for algebra.",

Open a spreadsheet such as Google Sheets and record daily minimum temperatures for your city over a week using the Bureau of Meteorology website.

      },
      parentTip: "Fractions and decimals together in one lesson can feel overwhelming. If your child is struggling, break the session into two parts: fractions first, then decimals. The most common errors are forgetting to find a common denominator before adding fractions, and misaligning decimal points when adding or subtracting. Keep encouraging them to estimate first before calculating. Year 7 students respond well when they understand the why, so link fraction division to asking how many of this fit into that.",
      extension: "Design a scaled recipe project: take a real recipe that serves 4 and scale it to serve 7 using fraction and decimal arithmetic. Write all working by hand, then use a calculator to verify each step. Compare the amounts and think about what seven eighths of a cup looks like in practice. This brings fractions and decimals into a meaningful real-world context aligned to the Measurement strand.",

        script: "Flip this coin 10 times before we start and record heads or tails each time. How many heads did you get? Probably somewhere around 5, but maybe 3, maybe 7. The theoretical probability of heads is one half — that is what we expect in the long run. But in a short experiment, anything can happen. Probability is about what should happen over many, many trials, not what will happen in just one.",
        action: "Have your child flip a coin 10 times and record results. Count heads. Discuss: does not getting exactly 5 mean the coin is unfair? Introduce the idea that as the number of trials increases, the experimental result gets closer to the theoretical probability.",
      },
      mainActivity: {
        title: "Calculating Theoretical Probability",
        script: "Probability is the number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of equally likely outcomes. Rolling a 3 on a standard die: there is 1 favourable outcome and 6 total outcomes, so the probability is one sixth. The complement is the probability of the event NOT happening. If the probability of rain is 0.3, then the probability of no rain is 1 minus 0.3 equals 0.7. The sample space for rolling a die is all six outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",
        action: "Work through three examples: rolling a die, drawing from a bag of coloured counters, and a complementary probability. Have your child list the sample space for flipping two coins (HH, HT, TH, TT = 4 outcomes) and calculate the probability of getting exactly one head. Then try a complementary event with a spinner.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Predict Then Test",
        script: "A bag has 4 red counters and 6 blue counters. What is the theoretical probability of picking red? If you picked a counter 50 times and replaced it each time, how many reds would you expect? Now roll the die 12 times and record results. Is every number showing up exactly twice? Why not?",
        action: "Have your child answer the bag question (4 out of 10, or 2 out of 5) and predict 50 x 0.4 = 20 reds. Then do the die-rolling experiment and compare results to the expected 2 of each number per 12 rolls. Discuss the variability. This directly prepares them for the worksheet design-an-experiment section.",
      },
      parentTip: "Probability is one of those topics where intuition and mathematics regularly disagree, so embrace that tension. If your child is confident but wrong, run the experiment and let the data challenge their prediction — this is far more memorable than correction. Common misconceptions include the gambler's fallacy, believing past random outcomes affect future ones, and assuming experimental results will perfectly match theoretical probabilities with small sample sizes. Fun debates signal real engagement.",
      extension: "Simulate probability experiments using a spreadsheet's RANDBETWEEN function to simulate rolling a die 100 times. Record the frequencies, calculate experimental probabilities, and compare them to the theoretical values. Then investigate: how many trials do you need before the experimental probabilities reliably approach the theoretical ones? Graph the experimental probability after every 10 trials to watch it converge toward the theoretical value as sample size increases.",
