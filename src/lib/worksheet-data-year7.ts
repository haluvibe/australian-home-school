        title: "What Are Prime Numbers?",
        script: "Let us start with a question: can you make a rectangle using exactly 7 tiles? Try it. What about 12 tiles? With 12 you can make several different rectangles. Numbers like 12 that can be arranged into multiple rectangles are called composite. Numbers like 7 that only make one skinny rectangle are called prime. Today we are going to pull composite numbers apart until every piece is prime.",
        action: "If you have coins or small blocks, have your child try to arrange 7 objects into rectangles, then 12 objects. Discuss why 7 only works as 1 x 7. List a few primes together on paper: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Factor Trees and Exponents",
        script: "Let us break down 24 together. I will draw a factor tree. 24 splits into 4 and 6. Then 4 splits into 2 and 2, and 6 splits into 2 and 3. Our prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 3. Because we have three 2s, we write that as 2 to the power of 3, then multiply by 3. So 24 equals 2 cubed times 3. Now you try 36 on your own and I will check your tree.",
        action: "Draw the factor tree for 24 on paper, talking through each branch. Show how repeated primes collapse into exponent notation. Have your child draw their own tree for 36 and check it gives 2 squared times 3 squared. Then try 48 together.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Why Does This Matter?",
        script: "Can you think of why we might need to break numbers into prime factors? It turns out it helps us find the highest common factor of two numbers — really useful when simplifying fractions. Tell me in your own words: what is a prime number, and what does an exponent tell us?",
        action: "Have your child explain both concepts aloud. Ask them to quickly write the prime factorisation of 30 without a tree. Check the answer is 2 times 3 times 5.",
      },
      parentTip: "Factor trees are often a lightbulb moment, so if your child finds them satisfying let them run with larger numbers like 360 or 1024. If they are struggling to remember which numbers are prime, keep a short list visible on the desk — checking against a list is a legitimate strategy, not cheating. Year 7 students often confuse 1 as prime; gently remind them that 1 is neither prime nor composite.",
      extension: "Challenge your student to use prime factorisation to find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of three numbers at once — try 12, 18 and 30. They should list the prime factorisation of each, then identify shared and combined primes. As an extension to the extension, look up RSA encryption online: it uses the difficulty of factorising very large numbers to keep internet data safe.",

That is why we call 25 a perfect square — it can form a perfect square shape. The square root of 25 is 5 because 5 is the side length. Let us draw some squares and see the pattern.",

        title: "Squaring and Rooting",
        script: "Squaring means multiplying a number by itself. So 7 squared is 7 times 7 equals 49. The square root goes the other way: if I tell you the area of a square is 49, you need to find the side length. What number times itself gives 49? That is 7. We write that as the square root of 49 equals 7. Now let us estimate: is the square root of 50 closer to 7 or 8?",
        action: "Work through squaring the numbers 1 to 12, having your child call them out from memory or compute them.

Letting them self-check with area diagrams builds lasting understanding.",

Negative numbers live to the left of zero on the number line. A bank balance of minus 10 dollars means you owe money. Let us draw a number line from negative 10 to positive 10 and place some real-world examples on it.",

You move 9 steps left. Where do you land? Here is the tricky bit: subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. So 6 minus negative 2 is the same as 6 plus 2, which is 8.",
        action: "Work through at least 6 examples together on the number line, using a pencil to physically trace the movement.

If 5 minus negative 3 equals 8 causes confusion, the number line is your best friend: start at 5 and removing a negative means moving right. Keep a thermometer or a drawn number line nearby throughout this lesson. Be patient if your child needs several concrete examples before moving to abstract working; this concept is foundational for algebra.",

Open a spreadsheet such as Google Sheets and record daily minimum temperatures for your city over a week using the Bureau of Meteorology website.

      },
      parentTip: "Fractions and decimals together in one lesson can feel overwhelming. If your child is struggling, break the session into two parts: fractions first, then decimals. The most common errors are forgetting to find a common denominator before adding fractions, and misaligning decimal points when adding or subtracting. Keep encouraging them to estimate first before calculating. Year 7 students respond well when they understand the why, so link fraction division to asking how many of this fit into that.",
      extension: "Design a scaled recipe project: take a real recipe that serves 4 and scale it to serve 7 using fraction and decimal arithmetic. Write all working by hand, then use a calculator to verify each step. Compare the amounts and think about what seven eighths of a cup looks like in practice. This brings fractions and decimals into a meaningful real-world context aligned to the Measurement strand.",

        title: "The Taxi Meter",
        script: "Imagine a taxi that charges $3 to get in and then $2 for every kilometre. After 1 km you pay $5. After 2 km you pay $7. After 3 km you pay $9. There is a pattern: each extra kilometre adds $2. We can write a rule: total cost C equals 3 plus 2 times the number of km. A table of values helps us see the pattern clearly and predict future values without computing one by one.",
        action: "Draw a two-column table labelled km (input) and Cost in dollars (output). Fill in rows for 0 through 5 km together. Discuss: what does the output do each time the input goes up by 1? Identify the constant increase of $2 and connect it to the coefficient in the rule.",

        title: "Building Tables from Rules",
        script: "For the rule y equals 2x plus 1, I substitute x equals 0, 1, 2, 3 to get y equals 1, 3, 5, 7. The y values go up by 2 each time because x is multiplied by 2. Now you build a table for y equals 3x minus 2 with x from 0 to 4. Then I will give you a table with some x and y values and you find the rule.",
        action: "Have your child complete the table for y = 3x - 2 independently, then check. Next, show a table where x is 1, 2, 3, 4 and y is 3, 6, 9, 12. Ask: what rule connects x to y? Guide them to try y = 3x first by testing one row, then verify with another. This is the reverse-engineering the worksheet tests.",

        title: "Growing or Shrinking?",
        script: "Look at the rule y equals 10 minus x. As x gets bigger, what happens to y? And for y equals 5, does y change at all as x changes? Now describe in your own words: what is a table of values for, and how do you find the rule from a table?",
        action: "Have your child complete both answers verbally, then write one sentence each. Listen for key ideas: the coefficient controls whether the pattern grows or shrinks, and a constant rule produces a flat table. Ask them to make up one rule themselves and build a 5-row table you then have to guess.",
      },
      parentTip: "Tables of values are the bridge between rules and graphs, so investing time here pays off strongly in later topics. If your child completes a table correctly but cannot identify the rule, encourage them to look at what changes by a constant amount as x increases — that constant is the coefficient of x. A common error is writing output values in the wrong order or miscounting the pattern. Having them read each row aloud reinforces the input-output relationship.",
      extension: "Choose a real-world linear relationship to investigate, for example the cost of apples at $2.50 each or distance covered jogging at 8 km/h. Build a table of values, write the algebraic rule, and then plot the points on Desmos at https://www.desmos.com/calculator. Observe that a constant rate of change produces a straight line. Then find a non-linear example such as n squared or 2 to the power of n and compare the shape of the graph.",

A helpful reminder is that a triangle is exactly half of a parallelogram with the same base and height — draw the parallelogram around the triangle to make this visual. For parallelograms, watch that your student uses the perpendicular height and not the slant side. If they have access to scissors and grid paper, cutting and rearranging shapes into rectangles is a powerful concrete experience.",
