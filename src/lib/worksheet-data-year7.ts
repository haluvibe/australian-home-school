Because we have three 2s, we write that as 2 to the power of 3, then multiply by 3. So 24 equals 2 cubed times 3. Now you try 36 on your own and I will check your tree.",

Year 7 students often confuse 1 as prime; gently remind them that 1 is neither prime nor composite.",

        script: "Flip this coin 10 times before we start and record heads or tails each time. How many heads did you get? Probably somewhere around 5, but maybe 3, maybe 7. The theoretical probability of heads is one half — that is what we expect in the long run. But in a short experiment, anything can happen. Probability is about what should happen over many, many trials, not what will happen in just one.",
        action: "Have your child flip a coin 10 times and record results. Count heads. Discuss: does not getting exactly 5 mean the coin is unfair? Introduce the idea that as the number of trials increases, the experimental result gets closer to the theoretical probability.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Calculating Theoretical Probability",
        script: "Probability is the number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of equally likely outcomes. Rolling a 3 on a standard die: there is 1 favourable outcome and 6 total outcomes, so the probability is one sixth. The complement is the probability of the event NOT happening. If the probability of rain is 0.3, then the probability of no rain is 1 minus 0.3 equals 0.7. The sample space for rolling a die is all six outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",
        action: "Work through three examples: rolling a die, drawing from a bag of coloured counters, and a complementary probability. Have your child list the sample space for flipping two coins (HH, HT, TH, TT = 4 outcomes) and calculate the probability of getting exactly one head. Then try a complementary event with a spinner.",

      wrapUp: {
        title: "Predict Then Test",
        script: "A bag has 4 red counters and 6 blue counters. What is the theoretical probability of picking red? If you picked a counter 50 times and replaced it each time, how many reds would you expect? Now roll the die 12 times and record results. Is every number showing up exactly twice? Why not?",
        action: "Have your child answer the bag question (4 out of 10, or 2 out of 5) and predict 50 x 0.4 = 20 reds. Then do the die-rolling experiment and compare results to the expected 2 of each number per 12 rolls. Discuss the variability. This directly prepares them for the worksheet design-an-experiment section.",
      },
      parentTip: "Probability is one of those topics where intuition and mathematics regularly disagree, so embrace that tension. If your child is confident but wrong, run the experiment and let the data challenge their prediction — this is far more memorable than correction. Common misconceptions include the gambler's fallacy, believing past random outcomes affect future ones, and assuming experimental results will perfectly match theoretical probabilities with small sample sizes. Fun debates signal real engagement.",
      extension: "Simulate probability experiments using a spreadsheet's RANDBETWEEN function to simulate rolling a die 100 times. Record the frequencies, calculate experimental probabilities, and compare them to the theoretical values. Then investigate: how many trials do you need before the experimental probabilities reliably approach the theoretical ones? Graph the experimental probability after every 10 trials to watch it converge toward the theoretical value as sample size increases.",
