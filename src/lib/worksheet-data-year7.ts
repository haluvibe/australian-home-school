        title: "What Are Prime Numbers?",
        script: "Let us start with a question: can you make a rectangle using exactly 7 tiles? Try it. What about 12 tiles? With 12 you can make several different rectangles. Numbers like 12 that can be arranged into multiple rectangles are called composite. Numbers like 7 that only make one skinny rectangle are called prime. Today we are going to pull composite numbers apart until every piece is prime.",
        action: "If you have coins or small blocks, have your child try to arrange 7 objects into rectangles, then 12 objects. Discuss why 7 only works as 1 x 7. List a few primes together on paper: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.",

      mainActivity: {
        title: "Factor Trees and Exponents",
        script: "Let us break down 24 together. I will draw a factor tree. 24 splits into 4 and 6. Then 4 splits into 2 and 2, and 6 splits into 2 and 3. Our prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 3. Because we have three 2s, we write that as 2 to the power of 3, then multiply by 3. So 24 equals 2 cubed times 3. Now you try 36 on your own and I will check your tree.",
        action: "Draw the factor tree for 24 on paper, talking through each branch. Show how repeated primes collapse into exponent notation. Have your child draw their own tree for 36 and check it gives 2 squared times 3 squared. Then try 48 together.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Why Does This Matter?",
        script: "Can you think of why we might need to break numbers into prime factors? It turns out it helps us find the highest common factor of two numbers — really useful when simplifying fractions. Tell me in your own words: what is a prime number, and what does an exponent tell us?",
        action: "Have your child explain both concepts aloud. Ask them to quickly write the prime factorisation of 30 without a tree. Check the answer is 2 times 3 times 5.",
      },
      parentTip: "Factor trees are often a lightbulb moment, so if your child finds them satisfying let them run with larger numbers like 360 or 1024. If they are struggling to remember which numbers are prime, keep a short list visible on the desk — checking against a list is a legitimate strategy, not cheating. Year 7 students often confuse 1 as prime; gently remind them that 1 is neither prime nor composite.",
      extension: "Challenge your student to use prime factorisation to find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of three numbers at once — try 12, 18 and 30. They should list the prime factorisation of each, then identify shared and combined primes. As an extension to the extension, look up RSA encryption online: it uses the difficulty of factorising very large numbers to keep internet data safe.",

That is why we call 25 a perfect square — it can form a perfect square shape. The square root of 25 is 5 because 5 is the side length. Let us draw some squares and see the pattern.",

        title: "Squaring and Rooting",
        script: "Squaring means multiplying a number by itself. So 7 squared is 7 times 7 equals 49. The square root goes the other way: if I tell you the area of a square is 49, you need to find the side length. What number times itself gives 49? That is 7. We write that as the square root of 49 equals 7. Now let us estimate: is the square root of 50 closer to 7 or 8?",
        action: "Work through squaring the numbers 1 to 12, having your child call them out from memory or compute them.

Letting them self-check with area diagrams builds lasting understanding.",

Negative numbers live to the left of zero on the number line. A bank balance of minus 10 dollars means you owe money. Let us draw a number line from negative 10 to positive 10 and place some real-world examples on it.",

You move 9 steps left. Where do you land? Here is the tricky bit: subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. So 6 minus negative 2 is the same as 6 plus 2, which is 8.",
        action: "Work through at least 6 examples together on the number line, using a pencil to physically trace the movement.

If 5 minus negative 3 equals 8 causes confusion, the number line is your best friend: start at 5 and removing a negative means moving right. Keep a thermometer or a drawn number line nearby throughout this lesson. Be patient if your child needs several concrete examples before moving to abstract working; this concept is foundational for algebra.",

Open a spreadsheet such as Google Sheets and record daily minimum temperatures for your city over a week using the Bureau of Meteorology website.

      },
      parentTip: "Fractions and decimals together in one lesson can feel overwhelming. If your child is struggling, break the session into two parts: fractions first, then decimals. The most common errors are forgetting to find a common denominator before adding fractions, and misaligning decimal points when adding or subtracting. Keep encouraging them to estimate first before calculating. Year 7 students respond well when they understand the why, so link fraction division to asking how many of this fit into that.",
      extension: "Design a scaled recipe project: take a real recipe that serves 4 and scale it to serve 7 using fraction and decimal arithmetic. Write all working by hand, then use a calculator to verify each step. Compare the amounts and think about what seven eighths of a cup looks like in practice. This brings fractions and decimals into a meaningful real-world context aligned to the Measurement strand.",

Have your student test this by calculating compound interest year by year in a table for a $1000 investment at 6% per year for 15 years, then compare the actual doubling point to the rule of 72 estimate.",

If the left side has a mystery number plus 5 and the right side shows 12, what is the mystery number? You take 5 away from both sides: the mystery number equals 7. The key is always doing the same thing to both sides.",

        script: "For a one-step equation like 3n equals 24, the inverse of multiplying by 3 is dividing by 3. So n equals 24 divided by 3, which is 8. For a two-step equation like 2x plus 3 equals 11, I undo the addition first: subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x equals 8. Then divide both sides by 2 to get x equals 4. Always undo addition and subtraction before multiplication and division.",
        action: "Work through one one-step equation and one two-step equation in full, writing every step and labelling the inverse operation used.

      },
      parentTip: "The key habit to build with linear equations is always showing the inverse operation on both sides rather than moving numbers across the equals sign. If your child says I just move the 3 to the other side, gently reframe: we subtract 3 from both sides so the equation stays balanced. This matters enormously in later years. If two-step equations are challenging, slow down and do plenty of one-step practice first as fluency there is the essential prerequisite. Common misconception: students often perform an operation on one side of the equation but forget to do the same to the other side — they might subtract 3 from the left but not the right, breaking the equality. The metaphor of a balance scale is powerful: whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other to keep it balanced. Another common error is sign confusion when subtracting negative numbers — students need to understand that subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. Your child is ready for the worksheet when they can: (1) solve a one-step linear equation by applying the inverse operation to both sides, (2) solve a two-step equation (e.g., 3x + 5 = 20), and (3) check their solution by substituting it back into the original equation.",

        script: "Imagine a taxi that charges $3 to get in and then $2 for every kilometre. After 1 km you pay $5. After 2 km you pay $7. After 3 km you pay $9. There is a pattern: each extra kilometre adds $2. We can write a rule: total cost C equals 3 plus 2 times the number of km. A table of values helps us see the pattern clearly and predict future values without computing one by one.",
        action: "Draw a two-column table labelled km (input) and Cost in dollars (output). Fill in rows for 0 through 5 km together. Discuss: what does the output do each time the input goes up by 1? Identify the constant increase of $2 and connect it to the coefficient in the rule.",

Now you build a table for y equals 3x minus 2 with x from 0 to 4. Then I will give you a table with some x and y values and you find the rule.",
        action: "Have your child complete the table for y = 3x - 2 independently, then check. Next, show a table where x is 1, 2, 3, 4 and y is 3, 6, 9, 12. Ask: what rule connects x to y?

        action: "Have your child complete both answers verbally, then write one sentence each. Listen for key ideas: the coefficient controls whether the pattern grows or shrinks, and a constant rule produces a flat table. Ask them to make up one rule themselves and build a 5-row table you then have to guess.",
      },
      parentTip: "Tables of values are the bridge between rules and graphs, so investing time here pays off strongly in later topics. If your child completes a table correctly but cannot identify the rule, encourage them to look at what changes by a constant amount as x increases — that constant is the coefficient of x. A common error is writing output values in the wrong order or miscounting the pattern. Having them read each row aloud reinforces the input-output relationship.",
      extension: "Choose a real-world linear relationship to investigate, for example the cost of apples at $2.50 each or distance covered jogging at 8 km/h. Build a table of values, write the algebraic rule, and then plot the points on Desmos at https://www.desmos.com/calculator. Observe that a constant rate of change produces a straight line. Then find a non-linear example such as n squared or 2 to the power of n and compare the shape of the graph.",

Draw a parallelogram on paper, cut it out, then cut a triangle off one end and stick it on the other end. It becomes a rectangle! So the area of a parallelogram is also base times height, where height is the perpendicular height, not the slanted side.",

Confirm it equals the original base times perpendicular height. Then do the same with a triangle: show that a triangle is half a rectangle, giving A = half times base times height.",

        title: "Using the Formulas",
        script: "For a triangle with base 6 cm and height 4 cm, the area is a half times 6 times 4, which equals 12 cm squared. Notice the height must be the perpendicular height — the straight-up-and-down distance from base to tip. For a parallelogram with base 7 cm and height 5 cm, area equals 7 times 5 equals 35 cm squared. Now you try: find the area of a triangle with base 10 m and height 7 m.",
        action: "Work through both examples on paper with labelled diagrams. Have your child try the triangle with base 10 and height 7 (answer: 35 m squared). Then practice finding a missing dimension: if a triangle has area 24 cm squared and base 8 cm, what is the height? Guide them to rearrange the formula: height equals 2 times area divided by base.",

        title: "Composite Challenge",
        script: "A shape is made from a rectangle that is 8 cm by 5 cm with a triangle on top. The triangle has the same base of 8 cm and a height of 3 cm. What is the total area? Break it into two parts and add them together.",
        action: "Have your child draw the composite shape and label the parts. They should calculate rectangle area (40 cm squared) plus triangle area (12 cm squared) to get 52 cm squared. Check they use the correct formula for each part and add the results rather than mixing the dimensions.",
      },
      parentTip: "The most persistent error with triangle area is forgetting to halve: students often calculate base times height and stop there. A helpful reminder is that a triangle is exactly half of a parallelogram with the same base and height — draw the parallelogram around the triangle to make this visual. For parallelograms, watch that your student uses the perpendicular height and not the slant side. If they have access to scissors and grid paper, cutting and rearranging shapes into rectangles is a powerful concrete experience. Common misconception: the most persistent error is forgetting to halve the base-times-height result for triangles — students calculate b x h and stop, giving the area of the surrounding rectangle instead. Another frequent issue is using a slant height instead of the perpendicular height for parallelograms or triangles. The perpendicular height is always measured at 90 degrees to the base, not along a slant side. Drawing the height as a dotted line and checking it forms a right angle with the base helps. Your child is ready for the worksheet when they can: (1) identify the base and perpendicular height of a triangle and parallelogram, (2) correctly calculate the area of a triangle as half of base times height, (3) calculate the area of a parallelogram as base times perpendicular height, and (4) explain why the triangle formula includes the halving step.",
      extension: "Explore the area of composite shapes found in architecture or design. Search for a simple floorplan or house layout online, sketch it, and estimate the total floor area by breaking it into rectangles, triangles and parallelograms. Then use GeoGebra at https://www.geogebra.org/geometry to draw the shapes accurately and use the built-in area tool to check your estimates. Discuss sources of measurement error between your calculation and the tool.",

Make the unit explicit every time and say cubic centimetres aloud. Using actual boxes such as cereal boxes or shoeboxes to measure and calculate volume provides a powerful concrete anchor. At Year 7 the triangular prism formula can feel new, so emphasise it is simply the triangular base area multiplied by the length. Common misconception: students frequently confuse area units (cm squared) with volume units (cm cubed) — writing cm squared when they mean cm cubed, or vice versa. Reinforce: area is 2D and measured in squared units, volume is 3D and measured in cubed units. Another error is using the wrong measurement as the height — in a triangular prism, for example, the height of the triangle is NOT the same as the length of the prism. Students need to identify the cross-sectional area first, then multiply by the prism's length. Your child is ready for the worksheet when they can: (1) identify the cross-section of a prism, (2) calculate the area of that cross-section, (3) multiply by the prism length to find the volume, and (4) write the answer with correct cubic units.",
      extension: "Conduct a volume investigation using a rectangular container such as a lunchbox. Measure its internal dimensions with a ruler, calculate the theoretical volume in cm cubed, then convert to millilitres since 1 cm cubed equals 1 mL. Use a measuring jug to pour water in and check how many mL it actually holds. Compare the theoretical and experimental values and discuss why they might differ due to measurement error or wall thickness. Record all findings as a short written report.",

Divide the circumference by the diameter. What do you get? No matter what circle you measure, the answer is always close to 3.14. That number is called pi. Every circle in the universe obeys this ratio.",
        action: "Help your child measure circumference with string and diameter with ruler. Divide to see pi emerge. Try two different circles for emphasis. Record: diameter, circumference, and C divided by d. Both should be close to 3.14.",

        title: "Circumference and Missing Angles",
        script: "Since pi times diameter equals circumference, if the diameter is 5 cm then circumference equals 3.14 times 5 which is 15.7 cm. Now for angles: all three angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees. So if two angles are 60 and 70, the missing one is 180 minus 130 equals 50 degrees. Angles on a straight line also add to 180, and vertically opposite angles are equal.",
        action: "Work through two circumference calculations and two missing-angle problems. For the angles, draw clear diagrams and write the rule being used beside each calculation. Then give your child three to try independently: one circumference, one triangle angle, one supplementary angle on a straight line.",

        title: "Put It Together",
        script: "A circular running track has a diameter of 80 metres. How far do you run in one lap? And: a triangle has angles in ratio 1 to 2 to 3. What are the three angles? Hint: the angles must add to 180.",
        action: "For the track: C = 3.14 x 80 = 251.2 m. For the triangle: 6 parts total, each part = 30, so angles are 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Have your child show both worked solutions in writing before moving to the worksheet.",
      },
      parentTip: "The circle formulas for circumference and area are frequently mixed up — students will sometimes square the diameter rather than the radius, or use the radius in the circumference formula. A quick reminder: circumference uses diameter times pi and involves just one dimension; area uses radius squared and involves two dimensions. For angle relationships, large clear diagrams make a big difference. Let your child use a protractor to measure angles before calculating, which builds intuitive understanding alongside the abstract rules. Common misconception: students frequently mix up the circumference formula (C = 2 pi r, or C = pi d) with the area formula (A = pi r squared). A helpful memory device: Circumference is a line (1D), so the formula has r to the first power. Area is a surface (2D), so the formula has r to the second power (r squared). Another common error is forgetting to use the radius in the area formula when given the diameter — students must halve the diameter first. Your child is ready for the worksheet when they can: (1) calculate the circumference of a circle given the radius or diameter, (2) calculate the area of a circle given the radius, (3) distinguish between the two formulas and explain when to use each, and (4) convert between radius and diameter as needed.",
      extension: "Investigate where circles and angles appear in real architecture or design. Search for an image of the Melbourne Cricket Ground or the Sydney Harbour Bridge and estimate dimensions using any scale information provided. Calculate an estimated circumference or area based on those dimensions. Alternatively, use GeoGebra's geometry tools at https://www.geogebra.org/geometry to construct circles, measure arc lengths, and explore the relationship between a central angle and its arc.",

        script: "Not all data is the same. If I ask your favourite sport, you give me a category — that is categorical data. If I ask how many siblings you have, I get a whole number — discrete numerical data. If I measure your height in centimetres, I can get any value including decimals — continuous numerical data. The type of data determines what graph you should draw.",
        action: "Read out 8 data examples and have your child classify each one: favourite sport (categorical), number of pets (discrete), temperature at noon (continuous), eye colour (categorical), time to run 100 m (continuous), number of siblings (discrete). Ask: which graph would suit each type? Bar chart, histogram, or something else?",

        title: "Reading and Interpreting Displays",
        script: "A stem-and-leaf plot organises numbers by their tens digit on the left and units digits on the right. Stem 4, leaves 2 5 8 means the values are 42, 45 and 48. We can quickly see the range, the highest and lowest scores, and how spread out the data is. An outlier is a value that sits far away from the rest — for example, if most scores are between 40 and 70, a score of 3 would be an outlier.",
        action: "Draw a stem-and-leaf plot together with the data from the worksheet: stems 4, 5, 6, 7. Fill in the leaves. Ask your child to state the highest score, the lowest score, the total number of data points, and how many scored 50 or above. Then show a simple data set with one outlier and ask them to spot it.",

        title: "Plan Your Own Investigation",
        script: "You are a researcher. Write one statistical question you could investigate using the people in this house or neighbourhood. What type of data would you collect? What graph would you draw? What conclusion might you reach?",
        action: "Have your child write a question, name the data type and a suitable graph, and predict one possible finding. This mirrors the worksheet open-response activity. If they choose a biased question, discuss together why it might not give useful data.",
      },
      parentTip: "Statistical investigations are excellent for developing your child's ability to think critically about data, a genuine life skill. Encourage them to question data sources: who collected it and why, and could there be bias? If your child finds graph-drawing tedious, allow them to use Google Sheets which is itself a valuable digital literacy skill. The most important conceptual move here is distinguishing between a statistical question, one with variability in the answers, and a simple factual question with one correct answer. Common misconception: students often confuse correlation with causation — if two variables increase together, they assume one causes the other. For example, ice cream sales and drowning rates both increase in summer, but ice cream does not cause drowning. Another common issue is that students collect data but do not plan their investigation first — they need to formulate a question, decide what data to collect, choose an appropriate display, and then analyse. Your child is ready for the worksheet when they can: (1) formulate an investigable statistical question, (2) collect and organise data in an appropriate display (table, graph, chart), (3) describe the data using measures of centre and spread, and (4) draw a conclusion that answers their original question.",
      extension: "Run a real data investigation at home. Collect categorical data by surveying family members on a topic of your student's choosing, such as favourite breakfast food or preferred streaming service. Aim for at least 10 to 15 responses by including extended family if needed. Create both a frequency table and a bar or pie chart by hand, then write a paragraph summarising three findings. Discuss what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from such a small sample.",

But most people are earning around $210 to $230. The mean is not very representative here because of that one very high salary. The median, the middle value when we line them up in order, is $220, which is far more typical. This is why we have three measures of centre.",
        action: "Write the five salary values on cards and physically arrange them in order. Point to the median as the middle card. Calculate the mean with a calculator.

Mode: the value that appears most often — there can be more than one, or none. Range: the highest value minus the lowest. Let us work through the data set: 3, 5, 3, 7, 3, 5.",
        action: "Work through the data set 3, 5, 3, 7, 3, 5 together, calculating mean (26 divided by 6 = 4.33), median (4), mode (3), and range (4).

        title: "Choosing the Right Measure",
        script: "If a suburb has mostly houses worth $400,000 to $500,000 but one mansion worth $10 million, which measure would you use to describe the typical house price and why? What about the most popular shoe size in a shop? What measure would you use then?",
        action: "House prices: median (outlier skews the mean). Shoe sizes: mode (categorical-like, looking for the most common). Have your child write a one-sentence explanation for each choice. This directly prepares them for the sorting and open-response questions on the worksheet.",
      },
      parentTip: "Mean, median and mode are often learned as isolated procedures rather than as tools for answering real questions. Help your child understand when to use each: mean for balanced numerical data, median when there are extreme values that would skew the mean, and mode when dealing with categories or finding the most popular item. If they are solid on the procedures, push the discussion to which measure is most useful here and why. The range is a natural next step and connects nicely to the concept of spread. Common misconception: students often calculate the mean correctly but choose it as the 'best' measure of centre even when outliers distort it. For example, in the data set {2, 3, 3, 4, 100}, the mean is 22.4, which represents none of the data points well — the median of 3 is far more representative. Another error is forgetting to order the data before finding the median, or not knowing what to do when there is an even number of data points (average the two middle values). Your child is ready for the worksheet when they can: (1) calculate the mean, median, and mode for a given data set, (2) explain the difference between the three measures, and (3) choose the most appropriate measure for a given data set and justify their choice.",
      extension: "Investigate real Australian data by visiting the Australian Bureau of Statistics website at abs.gov.au and finding a dataset such as median household income by state or average weekly earnings. Record the values for each state and territory, calculate the mean and median, find the range, and write two sentences interpreting what the spread tells you about variation across Australia. This connects statistical literacy to real civic data and the Statistics strand of the Australian Curriculum.",

        script: "Flip this coin 10 times before we start and record heads or tails each time. How many heads did you get? Probably somewhere around 5, but maybe 3, maybe 7. The theoretical probability of heads is one half — that is what we expect in the long run. But in a short experiment, anything can happen. Probability is about what should happen over many, many trials, not what will happen in just one.",
        action: "Have your child flip a coin 10 times and record results. Count heads. Discuss: does not getting exactly 5 mean the coin is unfair? Introduce the idea that as the number of trials increases, the experimental result gets closer to the theoretical probability.",

        title: "Calculating Theoretical Probability",
        script: "Probability is the number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of equally likely outcomes. Rolling a 3 on a standard die: there is 1 favourable outcome and 6 total outcomes, so the probability is one sixth. The complement is the probability of the event NOT happening. If the probability of rain is 0.3, then the probability of no rain is 1 minus 0.3 equals 0.7. The sample space for rolling a die is all six outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",
        action: "Work through three examples: rolling a die, drawing from a bag of coloured counters, and a complementary probability.

If you picked a counter 50 times and replaced it each time, how many reds would you expect? Now roll the die 12 times and record results. Is every number showing up exactly twice? Why not?",
        action: "Have your child answer the bag question (4 out of 10, or 2 out of 5) and predict 50 x 0.4 = 20 reds. Then do the die-rolling experiment and compare results to the expected 2 of each number per 12 rolls. Discuss the variability. This directly prepares them for the worksheet design-an-experiment section.",

      parentTip: "Probability is one of those topics where intuition and mathematics regularly disagree, so embrace that tension. If your child is confident but wrong, run the experiment and let the data challenge their prediction — this is far more memorable than correction. Common misconceptions include the gambler's fallacy, believing past random outcomes affect future ones, and assuming experimental results will perfectly match theoretical probabilities with small sample sizes. Fun debates signal real engagement.",
      extension: "Simulate probability experiments using a spreadsheet's RANDBETWEEN function to simulate rolling a die 100 times. Record the frequencies, calculate experimental probabilities, and compare them to the theoretical values. Then investigate: how many trials do you need before the experimental probabilities reliably approach the theoretical ones? Graph the experimental probability after every 10 trials to watch it converge toward the theoretical value as sample size increases.",

        title: "Spark: Probability and Quantum Mechanics",
        content: "In quantum mechanics, the behaviour of subatomic particles can only be described probabilistically — not with certainty. An electron does not have a definite position; only a probability of being found in each location. When you observe it, the probability 'collapses' to a specific outcome. Albert Einstein famously objected: 'God does not play dice with the universe.' But experiments have consistently shown that at the quantum level, reality IS probabilistic. Probability is not just a mathematical convenience — it is woven into the fabric of the universe.",
