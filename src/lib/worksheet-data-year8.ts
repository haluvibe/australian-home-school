    lesson: {
      title: "Rational, Irrational and Recurring Decimals",
      objective: "Understand what makes a number rational or irrational, and tell the difference between terminating and recurring decimals.",
      materials: [
        "Paper and pencil",
        "Calculator",
        "Ruler",
      ],
      intro: {
        title: "The Number That Broke a Rule",
        script: "Did you know there are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction? No matter how hard you try, you cannot write the square root of 2 as a fraction. When the ancient Greeks discovered this, it was so shocking that according to legend, the person who revealed it was thrown overboard from a ship! These are called irrational numbers. A rational number is any number you can write as a fraction, like one half, three quarters, or even negative five. So where do decimals fit in?",
        action: "Write on paper: Rational = can be written as a/b (fraction). Then write a few examples: 1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 1/3 = 0.333... Ask your child to type 1 divided by 3 into a calculator and read out what they see. Point out the repeating digits.",
      },
      mainActivity: {
        title: "Two Types of Decimals",
        script: "When you divide a fraction, you always get a decimal that either stops or repeats. Watch me: one divided by four equals 0.25 — it stops, so we call it a terminating decimal. Now try one divided by three — it gives 0.333 going on forever. That is a recurring decimal. Both of these come from fractions, so they are rational. But the square root of 2 gives 1.41421356... and it never stops and never repeats. That is irrational. Now you try — use the calculator to divide these fractions and decide: terminating or recurring?",
        action: "Give your child these fractions to enter on the calculator: 1/4, 1/3, 2/3, 5/8, 1/6. For each, they write the decimal and decide terminating or recurring. Then together, try the square root button on 2, 3, 4, 9 — discuss which results are rational (sqrt 4 = 2, sqrt 9 = 3) and which are irrational.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Explain It Back",
        script: "Okay, your turn to be the teacher. Tell me: what is the difference between a rational and an irrational number? And what is the difference between a terminating and a recurring decimal? Give me one example of each.",
        action: "Child explains both distinctions out loud and writes one example of each type (rational terminating, rational recurring, irrational) on paper. Correct any confusion gently. The child is now ready for the worksheet.",
      },
      parentTip: "Teenagers often find abstract number classifications dry — try grounding this in curiosity rather than procedure. Ask your child to find the decimal for 1/7 on a calculator and describe what they notice; the sense of discovery usually lands better than a definition. If they seem disengaged, check whether they actually understand what a fraction represents first, since scope gaps often hide as motivation issues at this age.",
      extension: "Have your student prove algebraically that 0.333... equals exactly 1/3 using the standard algebraic method (let x = 0.333..., multiply both sides by 10, subtract). Then challenge them to convert 0.142857142857... to a fraction the same way. This connects to Australian Curriculum V9 Year 8 Number strand (AC9M8N01) and develops algebraic reasoning alongside number sense.",

Writing 2 times 2 times 2... ten times is tedious. Exponents are shorthand for repeated multiplication. Today we learn rules that let us simplify expressions like 2 cubed times 2 to the fourth without writing all the twos out. There are three main laws and they all make sense if you think about what repeated multiplication actually means.",

Quotient law: when you divide the same base, subtract the exponents. So 5 to the sixth divided by 5 squared equals 5 to the fourth. Power of a power: when you raise a power to another power, multiply the exponents. So 2 cubed, all to the power of 4, equals 2 to the twelfth. Now notice that anything to the power zero equals 1 — because dividing the same number gives 1. Try these: x to the 5 times x to the 3. Then y to the 8 divided by y to the 3. Then open bracket z squared close bracket to the power of 5.",
        action: "Write each law clearly on paper with one worked example per law. Then write one practice problem for each law and let your child solve them. Check by substituting a simple number for the variable. Confirm zero exponent: write 3^5 / 3^5 = 3^0 and show it equals 1.",

If your teenager rushes through by memorising rules without understanding, pause and ask them to explain why the product law works using a numerical example like 2^3 times 2^4. Understanding the why prevents errors later and also makes scientific notation feel natural rather than arbitrary. Let them set their own pace through the practice.",

Factorising is the reverse: if someone gives me 3x plus 12 and asks me to factorise it, I look for the common factor — what divides both 3x and 12? Three does! So I write 3 times the bracket x plus 4. Expanding and factorising are opposites.",

        script: "A spinner has three equal sections: Red, Blue, Green. It is spun twice. How many outcomes are there in total? What is the probability of getting Red both times?",
        action: "Child draws a 3x3 table (or tree diagram) showing 9 outcomes. P(Red, Red) = 1/9. If they struggle, remind them: 3 options for the first spin, 3 for the second, 3 x 3 = 9 total. Once they can set up the table and calculate correctly, they are ready for the worksheet.",
      },
      parentTip: "Probability is a topic where intuition often misleads teenagers — many will insist a coin is due for heads after several tails. Rather than correcting them directly, set up the experiment and let the data do the convincing. For tree diagrams, ensure your child draws the full diagram before calculating any probabilities. Note that the conditional probability activity is a brief preview of Year 10 content — treat it as enrichment rather than a core Year 8 requirement.",
      extension: "Simulate compound events: flip two coins 40 times and record all four possible outcomes (HH, HT, TH, TT). Tally the results and compare experimental probabilities to the theoretical values of 1/4 each. Discuss how many trials you would need for the experimental results to consistently come within 5% of theoretical. This connects to AC9M8P02 and statistical reasoning about probability and sample size.",
