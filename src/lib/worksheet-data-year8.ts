    lesson: {
      title: "Rational, Irrational and Recurring Decimals",
      objective: "Understand what makes a number rational or irrational, and tell the difference between terminating and recurring decimals.",
      materials: [
        "Paper and pencil",
        "Calculator",
        "Ruler",
      ],
      intro: {
        title: "The Number That Broke a Rule",
        script: "Did you know there are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction? No matter how hard you try, you cannot write the square root of 2 as a fraction. When the ancient Greeks discovered this, it was so shocking that according to legend, the person who revealed it was thrown overboard from a ship! These are called irrational numbers. A rational number is any number you can write as a fraction, like one half, three quarters, or even negative five. So where do decimals fit in?",
        action: "Write on paper: Rational = can be written as a/b (fraction). Then write a few examples: 1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 1/3 = 0.333... Ask your child to type 1 divided by 3 into a calculator and read out what they see. Point out the repeating digits.",
      },
      mainActivity: {
        title: "Two Types of Decimals",
        script: "When you divide a fraction, you always get a decimal that either stops or repeats. Watch me: one divided by four equals 0.25 — it stops, so we call it a terminating decimal. Now try one divided by three — it gives 0.333 going on forever. That is a recurring decimal. Both of these come from fractions, so they are rational. But the square root of 2 gives 1.41421356... and it never stops and never repeats. That is irrational. Now you try — use the calculator to divide these fractions and decide: terminating or recurring?",
        action: "Give your child these fractions to enter on the calculator: 1/4, 1/3, 2/3, 5/8, 1/6. For each, they write the decimal and decide terminating or recurring. Then together, try the square root button on 2, 3, 4, 9 — discuss which results are rational (sqrt 4 = 2, sqrt 9 = 3) and which are irrational.",
      },
      wrapUp: {
        title: "Explain It Back",
        script: "Okay, your turn to be the teacher. Tell me: what is the difference between a rational and an irrational number? And what is the difference between a terminating and a recurring decimal? Give me one example of each.",
        action: "Child explains both distinctions out loud and writes one example of each type (rational terminating, rational recurring, irrational) on paper. Correct any confusion gently. The child is now ready for the worksheet.",
      },
      parentTip: "Teenagers often find abstract number classifications dry — try grounding this in curiosity rather than procedure. Ask your child to find the decimal for 1/7 on a calculator and describe what they notice; the sense of discovery usually lands better than a definition. If they seem disengaged, check whether they actually understand what a fraction represents first, since scope gaps often hide as motivation issues at this age.",
      extension: "Have your student prove algebraically that 0.333... equals exactly 1/3 using the standard algebraic method (let x = 0.333..., multiply both sides by 10, subtract). Then challenge them to convert 0.142857142857... to a fraction the same way. This connects to Australian Curriculum V9 Year 8 Number strand (AC9M8N01) and develops algebraic reasoning alongside number sense.",

Writing 2 times 2 times 2... ten times is tedious. Exponents are shorthand for repeated multiplication. Today we learn rules that let us simplify expressions like 2 cubed times 2 to the fourth without writing all the twos out. There are three main laws and they all make sense if you think about what repeated multiplication actually means.",

        script: "I will show you all three laws and then you try one of each. Product law: when you multiply the same base, add the exponents. So 3 squared times 3 cubed equals 3 to the fifth. Quotient law: when you divide the same base, subtract the exponents. So 5 to the sixth divided by 5 squared equals 5 to the fourth. Power of a power: when you raise a power to another power, multiply the exponents. So 2 cubed, all to the power of 4, equals 2 to the twelfth. Now notice that anything to the power zero equals 1 — because dividing the same number gives 1. Try these: x to the 5 times x to the 3. Then y to the 8 divided by y to the 3. Then open bracket z squared close bracket to the power of 5.",
        action: "Write each law clearly on paper with one worked example per law. Then write one practice problem for each law and let your child solve them. Check by substituting a simple number for the variable. Confirm zero exponent: write 3^5 / 3^5 = 3^0 and show it equals 1.",

      parentTip: "The exponent laws trip many Year 8 students up because they look mechanical but require genuine understanding. If your teenager rushes through by memorising rules without understanding, pause and ask them to explain why the product law works using a numerical example like 2^3 times 2^4. Understanding the why prevents errors later and also makes scientific notation feel natural rather than arbitrary. Let them set their own pace through the practice.",

If they are resistant to slowing down, challenge them to mark their own work and find their own errors: teenagers respond well to autonomy and self-assessment.",

If I expand that, I multiply 3 by x to get 3x, and 3 by 4 to get 12. So the area is 3x plus 12. That is expanding. Factorising is the reverse: if someone gives me 3x plus 12 and asks me to factorise it, I look for the common factor — what divides both 3x and 12? Three does! So I write 3 times the bracket x plus 4. Expanding and factorising are opposites.",
        action: "Draw a rectangle on paper, label width 3 and length (x + 4). Shade two sub-rectangles: one 3 by x, one 3 by 4. Write 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12. Then reverse: given 6y + 9, ask what the HCF of 6 and 9 is (answer: 3), so 6y + 9 = 3(2y + 3). Verify by expanding.",

Watch out for the minus sign — it applies to everything inside. Now factorise 10a plus 15. The HCF of 10 and 15 is 5, so I get 5 open bracket 2a plus 3 close bracket. Check by expanding: 5 times 2a is 10a, 5 times 3 is 15. Correct! Now you do these two: expand negative 2 open bracket a minus 6 close bracket, then factorise 12n plus 18.",
        action: "Let the child work both problems on paper. For expanding, watch that they handle the negative sign correctly: -2(a - 6) = -2a + 12. For factorising 12n + 18, the HCF is 6.

      parentTip: "Algebra at Year 8 is often where the abstraction gap first opens up. If your teenager seems to get it during the lesson but makes errors on the worksheet, they may be pattern-matching rather than understanding the distributive law. Ask them to verify their expansion by substituting x = 2 into both the original and expanded forms — if the values match, the expansion is correct. This self-checking habit is more valuable than any shortcut.",

Then extend to a(b + c + d) with three terms and verify by choosing specific values. This connects to AC9M8A01 and the use of digital tools to verify algebraic reasoning.",

Choose a simple value for the variable (like x = 2 or x = 0), evaluate both forms, and check that they give the same number.

      extension: "Open Desmos (desmos.com/calculator) and type y = mx + b with sliders for m and b. Investigate: what happens when m is negative? When b is zero? What must be true about two lines for them to be parallel? Write a brief investigation report connecting what you see on screen to the algebra. This connects to AC9M8A02 and the use of digital tools for mathematical exploration.",

The scale is balanced, meaning x plus 3 equals 11. Now to find out how many are in the mystery bag, I remove 3 apples from BOTH sides — because the scale must stay balanced. What is left? x on the left and 8 on the right. So x equals 8. That is how we solve equations: whatever we do to one side, we do to the other.",
        action: "Draw two balance pans on paper. On the left write x + 3, on the right write 11. Cross out 3 from each side, then write the simplified version: x = 8. Verify: substitute 8 back in.

For inequalities, the process is identical, but instead of equals we use a greater-than or less-than sign. Solve x plus 4 is greater than 9. Subtract 4 from both sides: x is greater than 5. That means any number bigger than 5 works. The one extra rule: if you multiply or divide both sides by a NEGATIVE number, the inequality sign flips. Now you solve: 2x plus 3 equals x plus 7. Then solve: 3x minus 6 is less than 12.",

To find the area of an L-shaped room, you just cut it into two rectangles, find each area, and add them. To find the perimeter, you carefully trace around the outside edges. Today we will practice both strategies: adding parts together and subtracting a cut-out.",

Strategy two: subtract the cut-out. Start with the big 10 by 8 rectangle (area 80), then subtract the triangular cut-out (area 20), leaving 60. For perimeter: only count the outside edges — do not include any internal lines. Now you try: find the area and perimeter of an L-shape that is 8 cm tall, 6 cm wide, with a 3 by 2 cm rectangle cut from the top right corner.",
        action: "Draw the L-shape with all dimensions labelled. Walk through the area calculation together (8 x 6 - 3 x 2 = 48 - 6 = 42 cm squared, or split into two rectangles).

Now measure across the middle — that is the diameter. Divide the circumference by the diameter. What number do you get? It should be very close to 3.14. It does not matter what size the circle is — that ratio is ALWAYS approximately 3.14. The ancient mathematicians called this ratio pi. So circumference equals pi times diameter, or equivalently pi times 2 times radius.",

A stamp and a door are similar to a rectangle, but not similar to each other because their proportions differ. When we describe similar shapes, we use the scale factor — the number by which all sides are multiplied.",

For congruent triangles, we check using four conditions: SSS, SAS, ASA, or RHS. The AAA condition gives similar triangles but NOT necessarily congruent.",

Since each coin result can pair with each die result, there are 2 times 6 equals 12 outcomes. This is a compound event — two things happening together. When events are independent like this — the coin result does not affect the die result — we can multiply the number of outcomes. Today we will list all outcomes in a table or tree diagram so we can calculate probabilities accurately.",

Count the ends: 12 branches, 12 outcomes. For independent events, you can multiply probabilities directly. P(H) = 1/2, P(rolling a 5) = 1/6, so P(H and 5) = 1/2 times 1/6 equals 1/12. For complementary events, remember P(not A) = 1 minus P(A). If the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, the probability of NOT rolling a 6 is 5/6. Now you draw a tree diagram for flipping two coins.",
