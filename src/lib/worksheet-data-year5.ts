Those are tenths of a centimetre. 1.4 means one whole centimetre and four of those tiny parts. Decimals are just a way of writing amounts that are not quite a whole number.",

Now, which is bigger: 3.5 or 3.8? Both have three wholes, so we compare the tenths. Eight tenths is more than five tenths, so 3.8 is bigger. Let us order a few together before you try the worksheet.",
