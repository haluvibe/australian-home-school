They use mathematical modelling to solve practical additive and multiplicative problems, including money transactions, representing the situation and choosing calculation strategies. Students identify and represent part-whole relationships of halves, quarters and eighths in measurement contexts. They describe and continue patterns that increase and decrease additively by a constant amount and identify missing elements in the pattern. Students recall and demonstrate proficiency with addition and subtraction facts within 20 and multiplication facts for twos. They use uniform informal units to measure and compare shapes and objects. Students determine the number of days between events using a calendar and read time on an analog clock to the hour, half hour and quarter hour. They compare and classify shapes, describing features using formal spatial terms. Students locate and identify positions of features in two-dimensional representations and move position by following directions and pathways. They use a range of methods to collect, record, represent and interpret categorical data in response to questions.",

They use mathematical modelling to solve financial and other practical problems, formulating the problem using number sentences, solving the problem choosing efficient strategies and interpreting the results in terms of the situation. Students use their proficiency with addition and multiplication facts to add and subtract, multiply and divide numbers efficiently. They choose rounding and estimation strategies to determine whether results of calculations are reasonable. Students use the properties of odd and even numbers. They recognise equivalent fractions and make connections between fraction and decimal notations. Students count and represent fractions on a number line. They find unknown values in numerical equations involving addition and subtraction. Students follow and create algorithms that generate sets of numbers and identify emerging patterns. They use scaled instruments and appropriate units to measure length, mass, capacity and temperature. Students measure and approximate perimeters and areas. They convert between units of time when solving problems involving duration. Students compare angles relative to a right angle using angle names. They represent and approximate shapes and objects in the environment. Students create and interpret grid references. They identify line and rotational symmetry in plane shapes and create symmetrical patterns. Students create many-to-one data displays, assess the suitability of displays for representing data and discuss the shape of distributions and variation in data. They use surveys and digital tools to generate categorical or discrete numerical data in statistical investigations and communicate their findings in context. Students order events or the outcomes of chance experiments in terms of likelihood and identify whether events are independent or dependent. They conduct repeated chance experiments and describe the variation in results.",

They extend and apply the exponent laws with positive integers to variables. Students expand binomial products, and factorise monic quadratic expressions. They find the distance between 2 points on the Cartesian plane, and the gradient and midpoint of a line segment. Students use mathematical modelling to solve problems involving change in financial and other applied contexts, choosing to use linear and quadratic functions. They graph quadratic functions and solve monic quadratic equations with integer roots algebraically. Students describe the effects of variation of parameters on functions and relations, using digital tools, and make connections between their graphical and algebraic representations. They apply formulas to solve problems involving the surface area and volume of right prisms and cylinders. Students solve problems involving ratio, similarity and scale in two-dimensional situations. They determine percentage errors in measurements. Students apply Pythagoras\u2019 theorem and use trigonometric ratios to solve problems involving right-angled triangles. They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving direct proportion, ratio and scale, evaluating the model and communicating their methods and findings. Students express small and large numbers in scientific notation. They apply the enlargement transformation to images of shapes and objects, and interpret results. Students design, use and test algorithms based on geometric constructions or theorems. They compare and analyse the distributions of multiple numerical data sets, choose representations, describe features of these data sets using summary statistics and the shape of distributions, and consider the effect of outliers. Students explain how sampling techniques and representation can be used to support or question conclusions or to promote a point of view. They determine sets of outcomes for compound events and represent these in various ways. Students assign probabilities to the outcomes of compound events. They design and conduct experiments or simulations for combined events using digital tools.",
